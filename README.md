# Anti-League-Bot
A Discord Bot which tracks and informs you of your questionable League habits


Allows users to see how many hours someone has wasted on League whilst the bot was running, as well as whether they are currently wasting their free time.


This Bot will always track League activity so long as it is online.


To make it send a warning message whenever a player starts playing League:
- Set the channel you wish to warn in with /set_channel.
- Turn the alarm on or off with /set_alarm.

To change these settings, run the above commands again.
